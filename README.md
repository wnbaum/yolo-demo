# yolo-demo
This is a Streamlit app to demonstrate the usage of the YOLO v3 network architecture.

Make sure to download the weights for the YOLO v3 model [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1badlpEN1SHcDGcpylGikB5GftcWGr-7y).

The file should be placed in `models/yolo.h5`.

You can start the server in CLI with:
